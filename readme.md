Using any javascript framework, build a webpage that parses json from http://reddit.com/r/javascript.json

Your parsed json should generally reproduce the look and feel of reddit, but with an emphasis on unique ways to navigate and style the pages.

- Horizontally slide in the next page when scrolled to the end of the current set of reddit submissions, likewise slide out the current page to reveal the previous page if scrolling to the top
- Use a sharp, sans serif font, with a general bright color palette found by experimenting with https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/
- After 20 seconds of inactivity, blur the window with a "frosted glass" effect, transitioning it back to normal when you show activity
